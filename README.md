Since we have imported ERC20.sol, the basic functionalities is already been made, but we can focus on burning, minting and transfering of tokens

use the account address that can be found here

and/or copying the address, using the copy address button at the top.

Take note that the account you used to deploy is the owner, but then again you can explicitly use a specific account by changing all msg.snder to a specific account address

from there you can explore all the funcitonalities, for easier demo or testing, you can copy the account address in a separate text file so you can track accounts easily.
